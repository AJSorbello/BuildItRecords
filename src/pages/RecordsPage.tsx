        <Typography paragraph>
          Founded in 2015, Build It Records has been a driving force in underground electronic music,
          dedicated to curating forward-thinking sounds and nurturing top-tier talent. Our journey began
          with our first release on March 3rd, 2015, marking the start of a movement that continues to
          grow.

        <Typography paragraph>
          As the parent label of Build It Deep and Build It Tech, we embrace a wide spectrum of
          underground music, from hypnotic deep house to peak-time techno. We don't just release
          musicâ€”we shape the future of the underground scene.
