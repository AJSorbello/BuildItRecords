# Build It Records - Application Architecture

## Overview
Build It Records is a music label management system that integrates with Spotify's API to manage tracks, releases, and artists. The application consists of a React TypeScript frontend and a Node.js/Express backend with PostgreSQL database.

## Frontend Architecture

### Core Components

#### `App.tsx`
- Main application entry point
- Handles routing configuration using React Router
- Manages global state and authentication context
- Provides theme and styling context
- Responsible for the main layout structure

#### `Layout.tsx`
- Provides the common layout structure for all pages
- Includes navigation bar, sidebar, and main content area
- Handles responsive design adjustments
- Manages navigation state and menu interactions

### Admin Components

#### `AdminDashboard.tsx`
Primary admin interface that:
- Displays overview of label's tracks, releases, and artists
- Shows key metrics and statistics
- Provides quick access to management functions
- Handles real-time data updates
- Manages label selection and data filtering

#### `TracksManager.tsx`
Dedicated tracks management interface that:
- Lists all tracks with sorting and filtering capabilities
- Enables track metadata editing
- Provides track preview functionality
- Handles track status updates
- Manages track-artist associations

### Services

#### `DatabaseService.ts`
Core service for database interactions:
- Handles all API calls to the backend
- Manages data caching and state
- Provides typed interfaces for database operations
- Handles error states and retries
- Implements rate limiting and request queuing

#### `SpotifyService.ts`
Manages Spotify API integration:
- Handles Spotify authentication
- Manages token refresh and storage
- Provides methods for track/artist lookup
- Syncs Spotify data with local database
- Handles Spotify API rate limiting

## Backend Architecture

### Core Routes

#### `tracks.js`
Handles all track-related operations:
- CRUD operations for tracks
- Track metadata management
- Artist associations
- Spotify data synchronization
- Search and filtering capabilities

#### `releases.js`
Manages release-related functionality:
- Release creation and updates
- Track-to-release associations
- Release metadata management
- Release artwork handling
- Release status tracking

#### `artists.js`
Handles artist management:
- Artist profile management
- Artist-track associations
- Artist metadata synchronization
- Artist search and lookup
- Profile image handling

#### `labels.js`
Manages label operations:
- Label profile management
- Label-artist associations
- Label statistics and metrics
- Access control and permissions
- Label settings management

### Database Models

#### `index.js` (Models)
Central database configuration:
- Defines database connection settings
- Sets up model associations
- Manages database migrations
- Handles connection pooling
- Configures model validations

2. Advanced analytics dashboard
3. Automated release scheduling
4. Extended API documentation
5. Performance optimization for large datasets

## Maintenance
- Regular dependency updates
- Security patches
- Database optimization
- Cache management
- Log rotation

This documentation should be updated as new features are added or existing ones are modified. All developers should follow these architectural guidelines to maintain consistency across the application.
