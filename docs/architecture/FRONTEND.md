# Frontend Architecture

## Overview

The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Material-UI, following a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Key Components

### Core Components

- `App.tsx`: Application entry point, routing, global state
- `Layout.tsx`: Common layout structure, navigation
- `ThemeProvider.tsx`: Theme and styling management

### Feature Components

- `TracksManager`: Track management and organization
- `ArtistProfile`: Artist information display
- `ReleaseGrid`: Release showcase and management
- `SearchResults`: Universal search functionality

## State Management

- React Context for global state
- Local state with useState for component-specific data
- Custom hooks for reusable logic

## Data Flow

1. User interaction triggers component event
2. Component calls appropriate service
3. Service makes API request
4. Response updates local/global state
5. UI updates reflect new state

## Folder Structure

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── pages/         # Route-level components
├── hooks/         # Custom React hooks
├── services/      # API and business logic
├── utils/         # Helper functions
├── types/         # TypeScript definitions
└── assets/        # Static resources
```

## Best Practices

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow Material-UI design patterns
- Implement responsive design
- Write unit tests for components
- Document component props and usage
